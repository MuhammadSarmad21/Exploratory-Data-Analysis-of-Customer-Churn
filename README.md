# Exploratory-Data-Analysis-of-Customer-Churn

ğŸ’¡ What if your business could predict whoâ€™s about to leave â€” before they even decide? ğŸ’¡

Thatâ€™s the question I explored in my latest project: analyzing telecom customer churn to uncover patterns behind why customers leave.

Starting with raw CSV data, I:
ğŸ”¹ Cleaned and prepared the dataset by handling missing values, fixing data types, and ensuring consistency.
ğŸ”¹ Used Python (Pandas, NumPy) for data wrangling and Seaborn & Matplotlib for creating insightful, visually compelling charts.
ğŸ”¹ Explored churn trends across different factors like gender, senior citizen status, tenure length, and contract type.
ğŸ”¹ Discovered patterns that can help businesses identify at-risk customers early and improve retention strategies.

Some key insights:
ğŸ“Œ Customers with shorter tenure and month-to-month contracts show significantly higher churn rates.
ğŸ“Œ Senior citizen customers tend to have a slightly higher churn percentage compared to younger customers.
ğŸ“Œ Contract type plays a crucial role in customer loyalty.

This project reinforced how data storytelling bridges the gap between numbers and actionable business strategies. The right visuals and metrics can help companies not just understand churn â€” but act on it.
